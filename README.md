Every ten years the United States Census Bureau conducts a mine information regarding the US population in order to inform the allocation of billions of dollars of funding to various endevors.

The goal of the assesment is to find the features that are associated to a person making more or less than $50,000 per year.

Once those features identified, the goal is to construct a data analysis/modeling pipeline for this problem.
